    takeaway: "Deep bench of expertise combined with a lean core team and broad sourcing advantage. Also explains the philosophy of Mosaic",
    content: "Let me introduce you to the people behind Mosaic. Our fund house was founded by Maneesh Dangi, who served as CIO and Head of Fixed Income at Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund for sixteen years, managing over seventy thousand crores. But Mosaic isn't just about one person - we've assembled a team of fifteen plus sector specialists with over two hundred years of collective experience across multiple credit cycles. What makes us unique is our structure: we maintain a lean core investment team of two to three members for nimble decision-making, while leveraging a large and experienced team for origination and underwriting. This gives us superior origination coverage compared to typical limited channel approaches used by other funds. Our team includes professionals from Goldman Sachs, HDFC, JM Financial, and other marquee institutions, each bringing deep domain expertise in their respective areas - whether it's NBFC credit, structured finance, real estate, or corporate lending."

    image: "/images/slide3.jpg",
    takeaway: "A fixed-income vehicle targeting mid-teens returns via secured credit",
    content: "Now let me detail our flagship offering - the Mosaic Multi Yield Fund Series 1. This is a Category II, close-ended Alternative Investment Fund focused exclusively on debt investments. We're raising a target corpus of one thousand crores with a tenor of four years and eleven months. Our return targets are compelling... we aim for a gross IRR above sixteen percent, which translates to a net IRR of thirteen to fourteen percent after all expenses to investors... Our fee structure is investor-friendly with a fifteen percent incentive fee... above a ten percent hurdle rate, and importantly, no catch-up provision. This means more of the upside flows to you, our investors. The fund structure allows for systematic deployment over the first year and systematic returns starting from year two, providing both growth and income characteristics."

    title: "Risk Return Spectrum: Performing Credit to Venture Debt",
    image: "/images/slide4.jpg",
    takeaway: "Emphasis on the lower-risk, collateral-backed segment to balance return and capital preservation. Also explains the risk return spectrum",
    content: "It's crucial to understand where we position ourselves in the credit risk spectrum. There's a continuum of credit strategies ranging from performing credit on the conservative end to venture debt on the aggressive end. We operate squarely in the performing credit space. What does this mean? We lend to profitable companies with no defaults, no stress indicators, established business models, and most importantly, all our investments are fully collateralized. These are companies that banks would love to lend to, but regulatory constraints prevent them from doing so - creating opportunities for funds like ours. This is distinctly different from special situations funds that invest in stressed assets, distressed funds that buy bad loans, or venture debt that funds loss-making startups. Our approach emphasizes the lower-risk, collateral-backed segment to balance attractive returns with capital preservation. We're not betting on turnarounds or hoping for equity appreciation - we're getting paid handsomely for providing capital where regulatory arbitrage creates supply-demand imbalances."

    title: "Building the Most Diversified Portfolio",
    image: "/images/slide5.jpg",
    takeaway: "Granular allocation across diverse credit niches reduces idiosyncratic risk while sustaining target yields",
    content: "Here's where Mosaic truly differentiates itself, and this is our core pitch: we are building a multi-manager, multi-strategy fund portfolio that is likely the most granular portfolio in the country. Let me break this down into three levels of diversification. First, strategy-level diversification: we invest across OpCos, promoter finance, real estate, and financials, with no sector allowed to exceed twenty to twenty-five percent. Second, manager-level diversification: no particular manager will underwrite more than fifteen to twenty percent of our portfolio - we're the only fund house giving you diversification at the manager level within a single fund. Third, security-level diversification: we cap exposure at five percent per firm, but likely we'll have three percent, targeting around thirty different firms. Our dedicated buckets include Financial Sponsor Funding, Opportunistic OpCo Funding, Mid-Income Housing, Rural Secured Finance, LAP, and Gold Finance. Each bucket is screened rigorously by vintage, leverage, collateral cover, EBITDA margins, and yield metrics. This granular allocation across diverse credit niches dramatically reduces idiosyncratic risk while sustaining our target yields."

    title: "Our Portfolio: Illustrative Deals",
    image: "/images/slide6.jpg",
    takeaway: "Portfolio comprises secured, high-quality credit lines delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns",
    content: "Let me make this real with two flagship deals that exemplify our investment approach. First, our SFC Environmental Technologies trade. SFC is a twenty-year-old company with eighty percent market share in wastewater treatment, seven hundred crore revenue, twenty-five percent EBITDA margins, and over one hundred twenty crores profit after tax with negligible debt. The company is IPO-bound with expected valuation upwards of four thousand crores. We're providing thirty-five crores to help the promoter buy a five percent stake from an exiting investor. Our security: three times cover from the five percent company stake, plus point six five times cover from prime Chembur property, plus personal guarantees from promoter and spouse with twenty crores liquid investments. Pricing: fifteen point two five percent XIRR. Second, our Strides Pharma deal. The promoter Arun Pillai owns three listed pharma companies with combined market cap over thirty thousand crores and total net worth of ten thousand crores. We're providing refinancing secured by two times cover of listed Strides shares, one point two five times cover of unlisted profitable Nary Pharma shares, plus personal guarantees. Pricing: fourteen percent XIRR. Both deals showcase our philosophy: exceptional collateral coverage, strong promoter quality, and attractive risk-adjusted returns."

    title: "How Mosaic Adds Value via Diversification",
    image: "/images/slide7.jpg",
    takeaway: "Broad diversification dramatically limits loss severity and enhances net returns",
    content: "This slide demonstrates the mathematical power of our diversification approach. Let's compare three portfolio construction methodologies and their impact on loss given default scenarios. A single bond exposure - which many HNIs do when they buy individual NCDs - can result in catastrophic minus fifty percent losses if that single issuer defaults. A concentrated portfolio of five to seven bonds, which many credit funds employ, fares moderately better but still exposes investors to significant volatility and potential losses. Our approach of twenty-five to thirty bonds across multiple sectors and managers delivers dramatically different outcomes. Even in a scenario where we experience defaults, our diversified approach delivers a positive fifteen point five percent post-default IRR. This isn't theoretical - it's mathematical. When you have thirty uncorrelated exposures with high yield and strong collateral coverage, the law of large numbers works in your favor. One or two defaults become statistical noise rather than portfolio-destroying events. This is the core value proposition of our granular, diversified approach - we're not just collecting high yields, we're building a robust portfolio that can weather credit cycles."

    title: "Industry Approach vs Mosaic Approach",
    image: "/images/slide8.jpg",
    takeaway: "Active redeployment of cash flows and origination edge drive outperformance over peers",
    content: "Here's where our operational excellence creates alpha over industry peers. The typical industry approach parks ten to fifteen percent of AIF assets in liquid funds earning six to seven percent during interim periods. This creates significant drag on portfolio returns. Mosaic's approach is fundamentally different - we employ active treasury management, immediately reinvesting interim principal repayments into NBFC credits earning thirteen to fourteen percent. This seemingly small difference adds fifty to sixty basis points annually to our net returns. But our differentiation goes deeper. Our traits include: true multi-sector diversification rather than sectoral concentration, granular exposure rather than concentrated bets, deep in-house origination capabilities rather than dependence on brokers, and a seasoned team with over two hundred years of collective experience across multiple credit cycles. We're not just portfolio managers - we're credit originators, underwriters, and recovery specialists. This integrated approach allows us to source better deals, price them appropriately, and manage them through their lifecycle more effectively than peers who rely on external sourcing or have limited sector expertise."

    takeaway: "Maneesh Dangi - Founder with proven performance, scaling expertise, and crisis-period alpha generation",
    content: "Let me introduce our founder and CEO, Maneesh Dangi. Maneesh brings an unparalleled track record in Indian fixed income markets. As CIO and Head of Fixed Income at Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund from two thousand six to twenty twenty-one, he directly managed seventy thousand crores and oversaw total debt AUM of one hundred sixty thousand crores. What sets Maneesh apart isn't just the scale - it's the performance during stress periods. He delivered four point five percent alpha over competition during the ILFS crisis of twenty eighteen and the COVID crisis of twenty twenty, precisely when credit skills matter most. Under his leadership, ABSL's debt AUM grew from ten thousand crores to one hundred sixty thousand crores, making it the top two debt fund house in India. Maneesh has been recognized with multiple Fund Manager of the Year awards in twenty eleven and twenty twelve, and holds PGDBM and FRM certifications. His approach combines macro-economic insights with micro-level credit analysis, and his experience managing public money gives him unique perspective on risk management and regulatory compliance that private funds often lack."

    takeaway: "Ajay Srinivasan - Veteran AM leader with pan-Asia scaling experience and strategic governance acumen",
    content: "Our Head of Advisory Board and Partner is Ajay Srinivasan, a towering figure in Indian financial services. Ajay's career spans building institutions from the ground up. He was the first CEO of ICICI Prudential AMC, where he established one of India's premier fund houses. He then grew ITC Threadneedle MF and led Prudential Asia operations across ten markets, giving him unique pan-Asian experience in asset management. Most recently, as the inaugural CEO of Aditya Birla Capital, Ajay created what became a top one hundred financial services conglomerate, overseeing mutual funds, life insurance, general insurance, housing finance, and NBFC operations. His strategic vision and execution capabilities are evident in how he scaled Aditya Birla Capital to become a leading financial services platform. Ajay brings to Mosaic not just his extensive network and regulatory relationships, but also his deep understanding of building scalable, compliant, and profitable financial services businesses. His PGDBM from IIM Ahmedabad and decades of leadership experience provide invaluable strategic guidance to our investment and business decisions."

    takeaway: "Clear organizational design with specialized leadership roles supporting robust governance",
    content: "Our organizational structure reflects our commitment to institutional-quality governance and operations. At the top, we have our MD and CEO providing strategic leadership and investment oversight. Our Investment Committee comprises seasoned professionals with complementary expertise across different credit sectors and risk management. We have dedicated functional leaders across all critical areas: Investment team for origination and underwriting, Sales team for investor relations and fundraising, Operations head for portfolio monitoring and administrative functions, Compliance officer ensuring regulatory adherence, and our CTO managing technology infrastructure and AI solutions. This structure isn't typical for many AIFs, which often operate with lean teams focused primarily on investment. We've deliberately built institutional infrastructure because we believe that sustainable performance requires robust operational foundations. Our senior team includes professionals who've headed risk functions at banks and NBFCs, giving us deep understanding of credit processes and regulatory requirements. Everyone on our team has long-term skin in the game, aligning their interests with investor outcomes. This comprehensive organizational design supports our ability to source, evaluate, monitor, and recover across a diversified portfolio of thirty plus credits."
